This dataset contains 1.9 million meals logged by 9.8K MyFitnessPal users on 71K food items from September 2014 through April 2015. Food items with similar textual description have been grouped together.

The dataset consists of data and item files. Their formats are described below.

data.tsv: 
Each line is a tab separated list of meal_id, user_id, date, meal_sequence, and food_ids. It describes a list of food items consumed by a user in a meal each day. The meal_sequence field indicates the ordering of the meal on a particular day, e.g., meal_sequence = 1 is the first meal of the day.

items.tsv:
A list of food tem IDs and names separated by tab. Each food name is represented by a comma-separated list of salient features where each salient feature consists of a triplet of food and cooking releated words separated by double underscores. E.g., egg_dairy__dairy_product__milk is a salient feature of (egg, dairy product, milk) triplet.
