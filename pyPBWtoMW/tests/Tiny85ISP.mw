== GVSDuino Rev X3 ==

[[File:GVSDuinoX3-cca.JPG]]

== GVSDuino Features ==

*GVSDuino takes two awesome boards and puts them together on one board taking the best of each and improving on both. 
**GVSDuino is the combination of an [http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardUno/ Arduino UNO] and a [http://arduino-info.wikispaces.com/SensorShield GVS Shield].
*The board is a minimalist Arduino design without a USB interface so it requires an FTDI board such as the [[FTDI-USB-TTL|USB-to-TTL Converter board]] to connect up to a Host Computer. 
*The board has [[GVS-Pinout|GVS connectors]] for all of the Processor I/O pins. 

=== New Features in the GVSDuino Revision X3 ===

The GVSDuino Revision X3 board is a re-layout of the GVSDuino Revision X2 board with some minor changes.

*Redesigned for [http://www.seeedstudio.com/depot/fusion-pcb-service-2-layers-p-835.html?cPath=70 seeedstudio Fusion PCB fabrication] (changed form factor to a 49x49 mm board).
**This is a larger form factor (49mm x 49mm, or 3.72 in2) than the original design (2.2" x 1/25", or 2.75 in2) which was optimized for size because [http://oshpark.com/ oshpark] prices their PCB fabrication service based on board size.
**Oshpark charges approximately $4.58 per board and seeedstudio charges approximately $1.50 a board.
*Jumper selectable power source selects whether the FTDI (USB) or the DC regulator will be used to power the board.
*Replaced the screw terminal block power connector with a 2.1 mm DC power connector.
**This is more convenient because an inexpensive wall wart can be used.
*The GVSDuino Revision X3 has an extended ISP connector intended to connect to the [[ATProgHead]].
**The [[ATProgHead]] board is a daughterboard to the GVSDuino Rev X3 or  later. 
**It mounts above the GVSDuino board and allows AVRs to be  programmed with the Arduino Bootloader. 
**Note that this is not the same as an ISP header to program the GVSDuino itself. 
**To program the GVSDuino board via ISP, the reset needs to be connected directly to pin 1 of the ATMega328P.

=== GVS Headers ===

The [[GVS-Pinout|GVS]] headers surround the Microprocessor. The square pins are pin 1. The Microprocessor I/O connections on the headers are:

== Board Dimensions ==

The board size is 49mm x 49mm.

== Future Improvements ==


* Add jumper for ISP header to allow pin to be used as D10 out or Reset-In. This would allow the card to act as a programmer or to be programmed.

=== Revision X2 Mounting Holes ===
*One of the things which separates the GVSDuino from other boards are the mounting holes. The board has four solid mounting holes, one in each corner allowing 4-40 hardware to be used to solidly mount the board into an enclosure.

== GVSDuino X1 Issues ==

[[File:GVSDuinoConnectors-v1.png]]

The board was unusable.

*The drill master file was not updated when the board was updated.
*Messed up pads include D1, R1, C1, C4, Vref select header.
*The wrong drill master caused shorts between power and ground.
