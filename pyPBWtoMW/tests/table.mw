== Design Advantages ==

*Gets away from all of the painful wire jumpers and pins that constantly come loose. 
*Makes the step from prototype to final design much easier.
*I thought that I invented the name, but http://www.itux.co.za/2012/01/happy-new-year-from-itux-co-za-whats-new-this-year/ someone beat me to it. 
**Since there was little information on the site and the seller didn't list shipping to the US, etc. I decided to make my own design. 
*Besides, I know that nobody will make it exactly like I want it.

|Mounting
|I2C Support

|-
|Processor
|UNO - $30
|Strip wires and solder to parts
|3 GND1 PWR
|Wires don't stay in holes with any stress.
|Poor
|No connector

|-
|Breadboards
|Uno - $30 +Breadboard $10
|Strip wires or use breadboard wires
|120 each PWR/GND for 700 point breadboard
|Moderately secure since the holes are usually &ldquo;tight&rdquo;
|Poor
|No connector

|-
|ProtoShields
|Uno - $30 +Shields - $15
|Lot of time- consuming soldering of custom wiring
|Vary but usually enough although maybe not connectorized in the best use
|Wires typically soldered so secure
|Poor
|No connector

|-
|Sensor Shields
|Uno - $30 +Shields - $15
|Use custom wires
|Excellent at 1 per Arduino Digital/Analog pin
|Connectors are secure
|Poor
|Yes

|-
|Screw Wings
|Uno - $30 + Wing Shield - $15
|Strip wires and solder to parts
|Varies depending upon shield
|Connections very secure
|Poor
|No connector
