This design consists of an Infrared Emitter and Infrared Receiver. 
The initial design was done with a

Radio Shack P/N 276-142  which worked fairly well.  

Using a 1M Ohm resistor as the Infrared Receiver bias value I got a nice voltage swing at various distances.

I didn't like the mismatch between the peak emitter (950mm) and received frequencies (850mm) and the cost of the Radio Shack solution is not cheap ($3.69) so I decided to look for new parts.

== Connector ==

J1 is a 4-pin 0.1" pitch header type of connector. The pinout is a modified [[GVS-Pinout|GVS pinout]].


# Ground (Square pin)
# Voltage - Transmitter +5V
# Voltage - Receiver +5V
# Sensor Output 


The purpose of having a separate transmitter and receiver voltage is two-fold. One it would allow the transmitter to be turned off and on conserving power and allowing for calibration at power-up. It needs to be noted that the drive current is greater than the current a microprocessor can directly drive.

The second purpose is to allow the analog reference voltage to be used for the receiver increasing noise immunity from the main power of the digital controller card(s).
