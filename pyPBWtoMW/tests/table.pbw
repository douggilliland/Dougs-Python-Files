== Design Advantages ==

*Gets away from all of the painful wire jumpers and pins that constantly come loose. 
*Makes the step from prototype to final design much easier.
*I thought that I invented the name, but http://www.itux.co.za/2012/01/happy-new-year-from-itux-co-za-whats-new-this-year/ someone beat me to it. 
**Since there was little information on the site and the seller didn't list shipping to the US, etc. I decided to make my own design. 
*Besides, I know that nobody will make it exactly like I want it.
