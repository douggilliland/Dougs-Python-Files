= Integrated Theremin =



The Integrated Theremin combines five of the Theremin boards into one design. The boards included are:


[[/w/page/55223153/MiniDuino|MiniDuino]]

** 16 MHz ATMega 328 processor
** Arduino UNO Code and IDE Compatible
** TFT Display connector 

[[/w/page/55092684/FTDI%20USB%20TTL|FTDI]]

** USB Interface
** Board is <strong>not </strong>powerable from FTDI 

[[/w/page/63417535/HVDigitalPot2|HV Digital Pots]]

** 10-bits, 1024 steps
** Control Frequency and Voltage 

[[/w/page/55033770/AudioAmp386|Audio Amplifier 386]]

** 3/4 Watt Output
** Standard RCA phone style connector 

[[/w/page/63697225/XR%202206%20X2|XR-2206 Voltage Controlled Oscillator]]

** Waveform Adjustment pot from X3 version of XR-2206 



The board has additional features including:


* Advanced Power Supply Design

** Single +12V power supply input
[[/w/page/62992363/IR%20Sensor|IR Sensors]]

*** Previous (separate board) design had a hot regulator on the MiniDuino 

**** Due to the current drop of the +12V or +9V to 5V 

***** At 200 mA due to the IR sensor cards


*** Total power Measured at 12V, 130 mA =&nbsp; 1.6 Watts 


[[/w/page/62992363/IR%20Sensor|IR Sensors]]
* Direct (DC) coupling for Voltage Controlled Oscillator to Audio Amplifier

** AC cap in series with the previous design led to clipping of the audio 

* Added connection to allow Microprocessor to monitor (via A/D) the VCO level for smoother volume control transitions

** Write all of the D/A serial bits then cycle the FSYNC line to load the D/A 
** Voltage divider

*** Average voltage into divider is 6V
*** Divider resistors 2.2K, 4.7K
*** Divider ratio is (2.2/(2.2+4.7)) = 0.31884
*** 6V * divider ratio = 1.913 V
*** 1.913V * (1023 counts/5V) =&nbsp; 391 counts
*** Peak voltage is 12V - scales to 3.82V which is safely below the 5V input of the A/D

** Measurements:

*** Minimum count = 278
*** Maximum count = 414
*** Average count = 346

** Measured the average voltage and it wasn't 6V as expected, it was 5.3V which correlates well to the 346 count 
** Where is the transition supposed to happen with respect to the waveform to write data to the pots?&nbsp;
** A/D sample rate is around 10K samples/sec
** If the max freq is 1KHz that means that the waveform is only sampled 10 times per cycle so there could be a large step in volume 
** Start up question as well - the board needs to be autocalibrated at startup 
** May need hardware assist to cycle FSYNC at zero crossing
** May want to connect the data and clock to the MOSI and SCK lines instead of PIO lines to speed up transfers
** May want to use logic analyzer to debug

* Board layout is slightly under 50 mm x 100 mm to use SeeedStudio service ($30 for 10 pcs). 
* Board has four mounting holes
* New schematic design using hierarchical sheets
* Split Power and ground planes (+12V/+5V) at center of card with jumper to connect GNDs
